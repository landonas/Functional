# Functional Programs 
This is a collection of projects that I have done in my spare time for fun and to further learn funcitonal programming languages. They range from Prolog, Lisp, and Python. I expect to add more projects and languages to this repo in an effort to better understand how these languges and programming techniques can be applied to Artificial Intelligence. 

If you would like to collaborate on any cool projects please feel free to contact me.
